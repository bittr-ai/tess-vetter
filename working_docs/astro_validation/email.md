Mike, Brian-

Thanks for the update! 

By the way, I'm including Brian on this email, but let me know if there's a way I should differentiate between emailing one or both of you. :) 

I saw the updated plots (in the feature/plotting-support branch) and these look like a nice start! A few comments: 
1) On ExoFOP, I see the correct TIC, TOI, Period, etc., but not the same RA and Dec as listed in the notebook. Any idea what's going on there? 
2) A folded lightcurve on the transit is essential for visual inspection. Makes sense to do this after the data is loaded in Step 3. That would also be a good time to list the candidate planet's radius, an important parameter to keep in mind. 
3) Similarly, the lightcurve for odd/even folding isn't there. While the odd/even depth plot is useful, astronomers like to be as close to the data as possible for as long as possible. 


A couple other quick notes. I used Simbad
https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=TIC+188646744&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit+id
to look up papers that included this object (although this is by no means exhaustive). This paper lists TOI-5807 in a big list of stars without obvious "proper motion anomalies", e.g., no strong motion induced by a companion star. I don't think that's super-relevant, but thought I would show you that method for finding info about a star in case you didn't know. It also helps show (but is not conclusive) that this planet candidate hasn't been published elsewhere or really even studied elsewhere. 
I looked on the ExoplanetArchive which confirmed all this: 
https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/overview/TOI-5807.01#planet_TOI-5807-01_collapsible
It also indicated there is some KELT and WASP data nearby. A quick look suggests that only the WASP data is relevant and there are hardly any data. These are not useful (which is unsurprising).

In other words, I don't think there is anything else known about this object that would affect the analysis you've already done. I'm not sure whether these resources are other things to pull into the vetting pipeline... I think most of the information was already essentially known from the other sources you are using.


NASA postponed the proposal deadline, so I won't be as available next week as I hoped, but I do plan on doing some things. 

I also figured I would practice using the Kolabtree timesheet. I'm using Clockify to track my time and will then input it into Kolabtree occasionally. I'm up to 1 hour. :) 

Best,
Darin
