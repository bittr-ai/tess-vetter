Mike, Brian-

Thanks again for hiring me to help on this. I'm confirming that I have access to the Github repo and I can get to the tutorial for the planet. 

As I mentioned on the phone, I've got a big deadline this week with the NASA Exoplanets Research Program grant proposal due next week! Still, I wanted to due a quick skim and have a few early thoughts. 
1) It looks very impressive. The code, the science, and the documentation all look very nice based on a quick skim. Grad students using TESS data could find this really useful!
2) One general rough idea that I would recommend is adding more graphs... scientists use visual scans of data to validate calculations. The lack of plots in the TOI-5807 validation is thus a bit jarring to me! For example, a similar idea from Kepler was the "Data Validation Reports" (like https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/data/KeplerData/004/004852/004852528/dv/kplr004852528-20160209194854_dvr.pdf) and the associated Summaries (like https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/data/KeplerData/004/004852/004852528/dv/kplr004852528-005-20160209194854_dvs.pdf) which you'll notice are filled with plots! (You can access these for a particular system at a page like this: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/overview/K00500.01). I can give examples of plots, but some are those you would already expect like a phase-folded lightcurve. 

Again, this is a super quick look for now, but I wanted to give you a couple of thoughts to get started. Looking forward to diving deeper!

Best, 
Darin
